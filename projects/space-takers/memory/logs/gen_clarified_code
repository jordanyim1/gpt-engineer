The core classes and functions will be:\n\n1. `Game`: This class will handle the game loop, events, and rendering.\n2. `Player`: This class will represent the player's spaceship. It will handle movement and shooting.\n3. `Enemy`: This class will represent the enemy spaceships. It will handle movement and collision detection.\n4. `Bullet`: This class will represent the bullets shot by the player. It will handle movement and collision detection.\n5. `Score`: This class will keep track of the player's score.\n\nNow, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.\n\nmain.py\n```python\nimport pygame\nfrom game import Game\n\ndef main():\n    pygame.init()\n    game = Game()\n    game.run()\n    pygame.quit()\n\nif __name__ == \"__main__\":\n    main()\n```\n\nNext, we will create the `game.py` file, which contains the `Game` class.\n\ngame.py\n```python\nimport pygame\nfrom player import Player\nfrom enemy import Enemy\nfrom score import Score\n\nclass Game:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.screen = pygame.display.set_mode((800, 600))\n        self.clock = pygame.time.Clock()\n        self.player = Player(self)\n        self.enemies = pygame.sprite.Group()\n        self.score = Score()\n\n    def run(self):\n        running = True\n        while running:\n            self.clock.tick(60)\n            for event in pygame.event.get():\n                if event.type == pygame.QUIT:\n                    running = False\n                self.player.handle_event(event)\n            self.update()\n            self.draw()\n        pygame.quit()\n\n    def update(self):\n        self.player.update()\n        self.enemies.update()\n        self.score.update(self.player, self.enemies)\n\n    def draw(self):\n        self.screen.fill((0, 0, 0))\n        self.player.draw(self.screen)\n        self.enemies.draw(self.screen)\n        self.score.draw(self.screen)\n        pygame.display.flip()\n```\n\nNext, we will create the `player.py` file, which contains the `Player` class.\n\nplayer.py\n```python\nimport pygame\nfrom bullet import Bullet\n\nclass Player(pygame.sprite.Sprite):\n    def __init__(self, game):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.game = game\n        self.image = pygame.image.load('player.png')\n        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(center=(400, 300))\n        self.bullets = pygame.sprite.Group()\n\n    def handle_event(self, event):\n        if event.type == pygame.KEYDOWN:\n            if event.key == pygame.K_SPACE:\n                self.shoot()\n\n    def update(self):\n        keys = pygame.key.get_pressed()\n        if keys[pygame.K_LEFT]:\n            self.rect.x -= 5\n        if keys[pygame.K_RIGHT]:\n            self.rect.x += 5\n        if keys[pygame.K_UP]:\n            self.rect.y -= 5\n        if keys[pygame.K_DOWN]:\n            self.rect.y += 5\n        self.bullets.update()\n\n    def draw(self, screen):\n        screen.blit(self.image, self.rect)\n        self.bullets.draw(screen)\n\n    def shoot(self):\n        bullet = Bullet(self)\n        self.bullets.add(bullet)\n```\n\nNext, we will create the `enemy.py` file, which contains the `Enemy` class.\n\nenemy.py\n```python\nimport pygame\n\nclass Enemy(pygame.sprite.Sprite):\n    def __init__(self):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.image = pygame.image.load('enemy.png')\n        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(topleft=(800, 300))\n\n    def update(self):\n        self.rect.x -= 3\n        if self.rect.right < 0:\n            self.kill()\n```\n\nNext, we will create the `bullet.py` file, which contains the `Bullet` class.\n\nbullet.py\n```python\nimport pygame\n\nclass Bullet(pygame.sprite.Sprite):\n    def __init__(self, player):\n        super().__init__()\n        self.image = pygame.image.load('bullet.png')\n        self.rect = self.image.get_rect(center=player.rect.center)\n\n    def update(self):\n        self.rect.x += 5\n        if self.rect.left > 800:\n            self.kill()\n```\n\nFinally, we will create the `score.py` file, which contains the `Score` class.\n\nscore.py\n```python\nimport pygame\n\nclass Score:\n    def __init__(self):\n        self.font = pygame.font.Font(None, 36)\n        self.score = 0\n\n    def update(self, player, enemies):\n        hits = pygame.sprite.groupcollide(player.bullets, enemies, True, True)\n        self.score += len(hits) * 10\n\n    def draw(self, screen):\n        score_text = self.font.render(f'Score: {self.score}', True, (255, 255, 255))\n        screen.blit(score_text, (10, 10))\n```\n\nPlease note that you will need to replace `'player.png'`, `'enemy.png'`, and `'bullet.png'` with the paths to your own image files. Also, you will need to add code to spawn enemies over time."}]
