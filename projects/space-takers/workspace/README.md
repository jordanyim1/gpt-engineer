We will be using Python and the Pygame library to create this game. The core classes and functions will be:

1. `Game`: This class will handle the game loop, events, and rendering.
2. `Player`: This class will represent the player's spaceship. It will handle movement and shooting.
3. `Enemy`: This class will represent the enemy spaceships. It will handle movement and collision detection.
4. `Bullet`: This class will represent the bullets shot by the player. It will handle movement and collision detection.
5. `Score`: This class will keep track of the player's score.

Now, let's start with the entry point file, `main.py`.
